## Description

Blepis formely developted under the name Beepis is being designed and created by HackMods, a hacker collective specialized in hardware. It is based on the original [Beepy by SQFMI](../inactive-projects/beepy.md) hardware with "a ton of new features, much-needed bugfixes, and a heap of small improvements". The HackMods team is releasing all their work as open source—hardware, firmware and software—thereby maintaining the open source philosophy of the original Beepy device and its [BBQ20KBD predecessor](../inactive-projects/bbq20kbd.md).

If you're looking to buy an out-of-the-box handheld computer, you'll have to wait... or order [a different device](index.md). At the start of 2025, Blepis are still being prototyped and developed. If you want to keep up with the progress, discussions are active in the original Beepy Discord server: [![Discord: Beepy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Beepy-null?logo=discord&logoColor=FFFFFF&labelColor=5865F2&color=555555)](https://discord.gg/QERrSferdF)

In December 2024, HackMods produced their first run of prototype boards and [announced them on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1108020055318462606/1108020058619400194/1316539999289610331). Each of these v1 PCBs has its components hand-soldered and assembled onto the board by members of HackMods. The team made seven PCBs available for pre-order to the community (now long gone). Each pre-order contained an assembled Blepis motherboard ("no soldering required") without additional components: recipients need to bring their own battery, display, Q20 keyboard and Raspberry Pi Zero to complete their pocket-sized computer.
